      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				You should use constants if you know that you're never going to change the value.
        Variables should be used if you don't know wether the variable is constant, or if you know that you need to change it later.
        They cannot all be constants. A lot of them need to change later in the code.
        It's generally better (if you have to) to use only variables over only constants
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				It changes in what order the program solves the problem. 
        It's the same as when parentheses are used in "normal" math.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				You can use the function "toFixed()" and put the amount of decimals you want in the parentheses.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				We can use an if-statement to check if the values are the same. 
        12.199999 is not the same as 12.2 in code (although it's practically the same value for us humans), so if you want to make it pass as "equal",
        you can create something called an "epsilon". You can then check the difference in value of the two numbers compared to the epsilon value.
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				Comparison operators return two values, either TRUE or FALSE, 
        and you can check if something is TRUE or FALSE with the use of an if-statement
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				The Math.random() function creates a random number every time it runs. It can be useful for a lot of things, 
        as there are many instances where it can be beneficial to have a random number. (For example in games)
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				Modulus is a mathmatical operation that figures out what you are left with. 
        It's very beneficial for the times where you only want something to be done the nth time (for example).
