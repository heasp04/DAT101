      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				You should use constants if you know that you're never going to change the value.
        Variables should be used if you don't know wether the variable is constant, or if you know that you need to change it later.
        They cannot all be constants. A lot of them need to change later in the code.
        It's generally better (if you have to) to use only variables over only constants

      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				It changes in what order the program solves the problem. 
        It's the same as when parentheses are used in "normal" math.
