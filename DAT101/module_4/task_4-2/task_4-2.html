      <li>What is an array?</li>
      <p>It is an object/variable that can contain more than one object/variable 
        as long as all the objects/variables are of the same type. 
      </p>
      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming?</li>
      <p>It means that you don't make things dynamically. 
        Making an array with the numbers in it, when you could make it with math/loops/programming 
        is a form of "hardcoding".
      </p>
      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is</li>
      <p>We split the array into words, and then it stores what index and "number" the word is. 
        By using loops or functions, the code knows when it needs to stop/when it has reached the end of the array </p>
      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?</li>
      <p>Makes it easier to access them</p>
      <li>Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
        example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
        wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look?</li>
      <p>I genuinely have no idea. I find it very hard to explain the question, as we've not properly learned about enums, keys, 
        or really gotten an explanation for how/what we could solve this on our own. 
        I personally do not understand why you would use hexadecimals for this type of task, 
        nor why you haven't explained it in the task that you're using hexadecimals.
      </p>
      <li>In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.</li>
      <p>It essentially waits with executing the function until everything else completes its task.</p>
      <li>What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
        if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
        both parameters each time the sorting routine runs</li>
      <p>It checks which value is the biggest I assume? 
        Have looked at your example, and will have to admit that I don't fully 
      understand what you've done...</p>
      <li>In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
        contains</li>
      <p>The first element in the array contains a new array</p>
