      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>It can make software development more modular, reusable and maintainable, 
        which can make it easier to upgrade and update the system</p>
      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
        how this type of object can help us in software development</li>
      <p>It's an object that keeps track of the different possible bank accounts. 
        Objects can help us with not needing a butt-ton of different variables, 
        which makes it easier to read and I'm pretty sure that it also makes the code run better
      </p>
      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?</li>
      <p>We do so, because it makes the code easier to contain and not available all the time. 
         It also makes the code safer, and easier to read</p>
      <li>Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function</li>
      <p>You do this by adding a "#" after "this." and before the variable name</p>
      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript</li>
      <p>You create a new instance of the object/class/whatever different datatype you want</p>
