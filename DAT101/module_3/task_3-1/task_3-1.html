    <ol>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>When it is exactly 7, the code in the if-statement runs. If it's not exactly 7, it will "skip" it, and nothing will happen.
        (Unless you have an else statement) </p>
      <li>Same as question #1. However, the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>When it is 7, the same as the prior question will happen, but if it's not 7, it will tell you that you need to use the car </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>It will tell you to take the car, as if it's 7, it will tell you to take the buss, while if it's 8, it will tell you to take the train</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>If the number is exactly zero, nothing gets printed</p>
