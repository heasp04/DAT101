      <li>In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?</li>
      <p>I mean, with hardcoding then yes. And if a "while" loop isn't considered a "for" loop in this question then also yes.
        However, it is a lot easier with a "for" loop. Also kinder for the computer.
      </p>
      <li>In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
        Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
        your answer</li>
      <p>
        To get an infinite loop, you need to make it so that the condition can never be achieved. 
        One way to do get an infinite loop, is to make the "while" condition a true or false condition, and never set it to true 
        (say that the condition for the "while" loop is while(statement == false)) 
      </p>
      <li>Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
        number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
        the program perform other tasks concurrently?</li>
      <p>
        Computers are actually quite fast at compiling things, making it so that it doesn't take more than a few seconds 
        (if we think about Task 3).
      </p>
      <li>Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
        change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
        matter?</li>
      <p>In a nested for loop, the relationship between rows and columns often affect the order in which 
        elements are accessed or processed. Yes, you can change the order, but the decision can depend on the 
        order you want to access the elements in the nested for loop. It can impact readability and performance.
        Generally though, there isn't really a reason to use a different order than the typical "row-column" one.
      Especially during entry level programming</p>
